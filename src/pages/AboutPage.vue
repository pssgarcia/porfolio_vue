               My name is Pedro Soares, I am an aspiring front-end developer. Recently graduated from Tamwood College, I have a passion for web development and love to create responsive websites and applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I feel comfortable working with JavaScript, Vue, React, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, MongoDb, HTML, CSS & SASS and a bit of Node.js but I'm always looking forward to learn new technologies and improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
               Aside from work, I'm a big fan of football, music and gym. Also, I'm a very easy going person and I love to meet new people and make new friends. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Additionally, I'm a fast learner and I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. I am currently looking for a job opportunity that will allow me to apply my skills and knowledge as a developer.
